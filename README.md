This repository demonstrates a common error in Rust when working with unsafe code:  directly manipulating the raw pointer of a vector.  The `bug.rs` file shows code that modifies the vector through its raw pointer. This results in data corruption because the vector's length is not updated to reflect the change, potentially leading to runtime panics or undefined behavior. The `bugSolution.rs` file illustrates the safe alternative, showing how to modify vector elements through the vector's methods.  This is a crucial example showcasing why Rust's safety features should be prioritized even when working with low-level operations.
